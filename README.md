# mvc-react

# Description
Service-Side only React powered MVC starter kit.

I have taken the type MVC patterns I have seen in Enterprise .net appliations and created a very similar style system.

The React is *static*. It is rendered to HTML.

## Why?
Traditional SSR is cool and all, but this can produce apps that don't require client side javascript.

The Internet existed before Javascript did... <forms> POSTing.

## How long does a React SSR page take to render?

Doesn't matter. Dictionary based caching can get round many problems as long as it is invalidated correctly. No dynamic elements remember.

## Server side Redux?
